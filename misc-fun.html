            <p>I thought it might be fun to add some extra content to this site. It's supposed to be a celebration of my learning, so I have included two things: 1) some screenshots of the "behind-the-scenes" of what this website required, and 2) some of my favorite assignments from the past two years.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Exploring the Appalachian Student Identity</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>In College Student Development Theory, we were tasked with writing up a case study exploring the experiences of students with a particular identity. As someone who lived in Southern Ohio within Appalachia from June 2014-July 2022, I had seen first-hand that students from Appalachia had unique needs that were not being met. That experience is what inspired me to focus on Appalachian students and their experiences attending Ohio colleges.</p>

                <p>This is easily my favorite paper I have ever written. The experience of writing this paper and realizing the complete lack of research on Appalachian students is what makes me think I will eventually return to school for a doctoral program. People write about and research the experiences of rural students or students in conservative states, but they don't talk about Appalachia as having a distinct identity.</p>

                <p>These students are often first-generation, low-income students from under-served and under-resourced K-12 systems. They don't have the resources afforded to schools outside of Appalachia, they don't have the capital to truly understand their options, and the unique culture of Appalachia is erased if they manage to get to college. Someday, I <i><strong>will</strong></i> do more research into ways that higher education professionals and institutions can better support this population of students.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Changing Gears (Assessment Report)</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>When I started this program, I was not entirely sure how I felt about assessment. After completing our two-part assessment course, though, I fell in love with this work. I have always been a 'fixer,' and assessment allows us to find areas of growth and it can help to highlight the things we are doing well.</p>

                <p>This report is the final culmination of our hard work throughout the course of this class. We set the bar very high for ourselves, and I truly think we met those expectations.</p>

                <p>Not only did we meet those expectations, we were able to submit proposals to both the 2023 NASPA Region I conference and the 2024 National NASPA conference to present these findings. Being able to travel with the full group to Portland, ME in November 2023 was such a rewarding experience. And then being able to go to Seattle, WA with one of my group members in March 2024? That was an experience I struggle to find words for.</p>

                <p>This report will forever be special to me, because it marks the beginning of my love for assessment, as well as the memories of working with an exceptional group of people.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>For my first big group paper of my college career, I think this one turned out pretty great. It was such an interesting topic to explore -- especially as someone who identifies as asexual/demisexual. My group was pretty great too, which made this whole experience infinitely better. As the first big paper, it will always be one I look back on fondly.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Highlights from Certificate Series</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Throughout my time in my graduate assistantship, my responsibilities have shifted around a bit. My constant throughout the experience was overseeing the Leadership Certificate Series workshops. This was also my favorite part of my entire graduate program, if I am completely honest.</p>

                <p>This program is what taught me almost everything I know about being a supervisor. It taught me about more of the little ways I can make my practice more inclusive. I learned too many skills to count working in this position.</p>

                <p>Without Cert Series, I would not have had the amazing (and often challenging) experiences that I did being able to supervise students and truly make an impact on their experience. Leaving my staff is going to be one of the hardest things I have done, and I have experienced a lot of really, really, hard things. This program is what got me through my degree -- specifically my students.</p>

                <p>So, on that sappy note, I have attached a couple of my favorite mini-artifacts from my time in this role. In collecting these, I have realized that my staff suffers from the affliction common with best friends, where we always have so much fun in the moment that we never remember to take photos together, which will be remedied immediately at our next training event.</p>

                <p>The first of these artifacts is our Self Care Bingo cards. I always emphasize taking care of themselves to my students, and creating this bingo card created an opportunity to incentivize them to do that. It also added an extra layer of fun to self-care given that my students are highly competitive with each other.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The second artifact is my favorite training activity to do with students. Not only do I think it's fun, but it also gives me and my students an easy way to understand each others communication style, team needs, and personalities a bit better. My students will randomly bring this up, and it is clearly something that sticks with them.</p>

Being able to create this really put into perspective everything that I managed to accomplish in my first year in this position and gave me a LOT of satisfaction.</p>
