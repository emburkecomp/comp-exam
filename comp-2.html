            <h2 class="dearmom">Mom...</h2>

            <p>I am convinced that one of the things you find the most hilarious about who I am now is that my favorite part of my job and this work is the people I get to work with. The idea that talking to people is the best part of my day? Yeah, I’m quite sure you get a kick out of that since that’s what you always wanted to see me do.</p>

            <p>It’s the truth though. Being a supervisor is the part of my job I love most. My students are one of the biggest reasons I pushed through when things seemed particularly tough and I contemplated leaving the program. They keep me sane and never fail to put a smile on my face. Being able to support students and be someone that I would have wanted as a student is the driving force behind my <i>why</i>.</p>

            <p>For most of my life, you were self-employed so you never really had a supervisor. Dad never really talked about his boss a whole lot when we were younger – just snippets here and there. I had no idea what a boss really was outside of what you see in the media, and we all know how reliable movies and TV shows are as a source of learning how the world works.</p>

            <p>I didn’t really understand what a supervisor or “boss” was until working with orientation. I had my “jobs” before that (cleaning stalls and paddocks for our horse friends), but I never really saw any of our friends as a “boss.” My supervisor for orientation, we’ll call him Mark, he was the first person I would consider my supervisor. And boy, did he set the bar high.</p>

            <p>He was the one who was there to watch me go from that shy person you knew to the brave, confident person who applied to grad schools. His unwavering support, willingness to answer all my questions, and dedication to making orientation programs the best that they can be made me love this work so much.</p>

            <p>The fact that he was so amazing and set the bar so high made my transition to my assistantship that much more difficult. Through a series of unfortunate timing, life circumstances and shifts within the organizational structure in and around leadership programs, I was essentially without a supervisor for months. As someone who thrives with a solid support person to help guide me along the way, being adrift while learning this new – much higher stakes than I’d had before – job, meant that the imposter syndrome and uncertainty had room to take root. I started to feel like that scared little 17-year-old again.</p>

            <p>While I was finding my footing and figuring all of this out, I was also handed a team of eight undergraduate students and a transition guide (that was not overly helpful if we are being honest), and told that this was my team now – I was now the supervis<strong>or</strong> instead of the supervis<strong>ee</strong>.</p>

            <p>At first, I pulled on the things I learned from Mark that worked well for me; an open-door policy, always having your students’ backs, and total transparency. I combined those things with what I wanted in a supervisor like open availability for questions and to be treated as a whole human. This combination was what I drew upon to be a good supervisor for my students. While I think I did okay that first semester (and even into the second), it was a rough transition and looking back I could have been so much better for those students.</p>

            <p>In November of 2022, I attended my first in-person conference: the NASPA Region I conference in Hartford, CT. While certainly not my favorite of the (now five) conferences that I have attended as a graduate student, it is the one that had a session that stands out to me the most.</p>

            <p>While at the conference, I attended a session called “Synergistic Supervision.” I am incredibly upset with myself that I forgot to write down the contact information for the presenters, but it was a pivotal session for my development into the supervisor I am today. In this session, they talked about characteristics of good supervision and helpful tips to be better supervisors for your staff. One of the presenters had a background in psychology, and she shared how she has pulled the idea of “Supervision Contracts” into her work in higher education as a supervisor.</p>

            <p>Now, the term “Supervision Contract” seemed a little bit intimidating for me to use with my undergraduate students, but the idea stuck with me. Upon my return, I started looking into them more and eventually my version – we call them our Supervision Agreements (it’s a bit less scary) – was born. While they seem very formal on the surface, they serve as a foundation from day one that I am open to being flexible with expectations, that I see each of my students as individuals with unique needs, and that I recognize that they all need different things from me.</p>

            <p>As you can see in the example below, these agreements provide space for us to explicitly name baseline expectations we have of each other, their role and responsibilities, my role and responsibilities, and most importantly, they help us set goals for what they want to get out of the experience in this role.</p>

            <p>In attending the Synergistic Supervision session and exploring more of what it means to be a good supervisor, I began to put together the pieces I needed to solidify who I was in that role. Creating the agreements put me in a position to reflect on what my expectations were and what I thought my students might expect of me. The latter was formed based on those things that I wanted in a supervisor and then my students and I expanded on it from there.</p>

            <p>As I discovered my identity as a supervisor, I began to find language that helped me describe my style to others. My identity and supervision style can be explained as: 1) humanizing, 2) team-centered, 3) authentic, and 4) transformative. Now, Mom, a word of warning, this is one of those topics I get excited about so prepare yourself for my nerdiness.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Humanizing</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>At the core of my identity as a supervisor is the idea of utilizing a humanizing pedagogy in my work. How can I expect my staff to feel supported and appreciated if I don’t recognize them as humans first? Thus, this is the first pillar of my supervision style.</p>

                <p>If we back up and look at organizations and organizational structure, we can focus in on one of the four frames identified by Bolman & Deal; human resources. Within this frame, it is emphasized that organizations (which higher education institutions fall into) exist to serve human needs, not the other way around (Bolman & Deal, 2013; Kezar, 2017). This relationship requires a give and take between the organization and the people working within the structure, and it requires a good fit to have the best outcome. For me, a good fit can be fostered through recognizing human needs before the work.</p>

                <p>In practice, this means that in every meeting or training I have with my students, we check in and talk about how they are before we talk about the work. Each week during our 2:1 meetings, we start with a high and a low before debriefing the workshops and talking through upcoming projects. Before we get into content during professional development trainings, we take the time to go around and share a rose, bud, and a thorn and we have a fun question (this has become such a staple that they – jokingly – riot if we try to skip it). By doing this, I find that it becomes easier to center who they are rather than just what they can do.</p>
            </div> <!-- END HUMANIZING ACCORDION -->

            <button class="accordion">Team-Centered</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>One of my favorite parts of working with orientation in undergrad was the opportunity to be part of an exceptional team. I wanted to bring that energy to my staff so they felt like they had an experience like that as well.</p>

                <p>With this in mind and using the humanizing mindset allows me to recognize what makes each of them unique and how they can best work together. To look at this, I pull a lot on Yosso’s Community Cultural Wealth Model, where we can take a deep dive into the experiences and cultural capital that each student brings to the team. My students are from different states, different socioeconomic backgrounds, different races, religions, identities, and more. Each of those experiences provides them with capital they can use to improve upon the team dynamics and our collective cultural “wealth.”</p>
            </div> <!-- END TEAM-CENTERED ACCORDION -->

            <button class="accordion">Authentic</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>During our first practicum course last spring, we learned about the idea of radical honesty. This is where we allow ourselves as figures who hold authority over others to be radically and authentically honest with others. By allowing ourselves to be vulnerable, it fosters an environment where – in this case my staff – people can reciprocate and feel safe to be radically honest as well. Any time I ask my students to answer a question or share the good and the bad that they experience on a daily basis, I am also answering the question and sharing what is going on in my life.</p>

                <p>I also draw heavily on the idea of Authentic Leadership as a model for being a stronger leader. This model requires that build genuine influence and rapport with others, have a solid understanding of yourself, know how to lead others, and know how to understand other people (Owolabi, 2020).</p>

                <p>One of the elements of this model that I try to work on the most is the concept that, “It’s important not to practice what you preach, but preach only what you’ve practiced” (Owolabi, 2020, 140). As a new supervisor, I relied on the idea that I could tell my students to do as I say, not as I do. Perhaps that may work for some, but as someone who wants to be as authentic as possible, modeling the way seems more important.</p>
            </div> <!-- END AUTHENTIC ACCORDION -->

            <button class="accordion">Transformative</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The last pillar I use to center my supervisory style is where I pull in Transformative Leadership. I want to highlight that I am saying transform<i>ative</i> and not transform<i>ational</i> here, because those are different things! I prefer to focus on transform<i>ative</i> leadership, because it pulls in more of a critical lens when looking at the overarching theory and goals.</p>

                <p>To use Transformative Leadership means I can bring in the humanistic psychology lens, that I can focus on growth and improvement on both an individual level and a group level, and puts emphasis on the fact that everyday actions have a huge impact on leadership, growth, and communities that we build. At its core, transformative leadership can be described as, “a participatory process of creative collaboration and transformation for mutual benefit” (Montuori & Donnelly, 2017, p. 3).</p>

                <p>This idea gives me the language to use when others may question why I put such a heavy focus on collaboration with my staff or why I emphasize the humanity of my staff so much. I can point to this when I explain that everyone can be a leader if given the opportunity in an environment that fosters growth and transformation on personal, social, and professional levels.</p>
            </div> <!-- END TRANSFORMATIVE PANEL -->

            <p>Even if I had a bit of a rocky start as I tried to learn how to meet this competency, I feel good with where I have landed. I think it must be working, because if you look at the student staff in each area of Leadership & Org Development, my staff has the best rapport, attendance at LOD events, and they are always the ones popping into the office to say hello or goodbye when they come in for office hours.</p>

            <p>We have been conducting new facilitator interviews recently, and they have nothing but good things to say about the position when the candidates ask. They always emphasize that coming to work never feels like work and they look forward to doing it. That is a compliment that always makes me tear up just a bit. And when they share how upset they are that I am graduating with them? Oh, an arrow to my soul. Honestly, I think they are secretly hoping that I fail my comps just so I have to stick around a little longer…</p>
