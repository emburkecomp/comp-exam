                <h2 class="dearmom">Dear Mom,</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="dear-mom-letter">
                <p>I often wish that I knew for certain that you were able to see how much I have grown since I was that quiet little seventeen year old that you knew. People always say, “She would be so proud” or “Your mom is smiling down on you.” That always sounds great in theory, but confirmation directly from you would be amazing.</p>

                <p>You tried for years to get me to be the kind of person I am today. You signed me up for classes and took me with you to events where I would have to talk to people. You practically begged me to be brave and step outside of my comfort zone. You wanted me to be brave and able to succeed in the world.</p>

                <p>I never thought that I would break out of that shell and be the kind of confident, independent person I am today: someone who is not afraid to respond to emails, make phone calls, or talk in front of hundreds of people without losing my breakfast. Most of the time I think no one could have seen it coming, but then I realize that maybe you did…</p>

                <p>I may not believe in God the way you do, but I definitely believe in capital “S” Something and I believe that you have some influence over things. Guardian angels or something similar make a whole lot more sense than some of the other things I can come up with for things that have happened to me since we lost you.</p>

                <p>Reflecting back, I have no idea what possessed me to hit that “submit” button on my application to be an orientation leader. That position was so far outside of my comfort zone that it is honestly laughable. Add in the fact that I technically should not have been hired because of a hidden technicality, and all signs point to you.</p>

                <p>Getting that job as an orientation leader was the best thing that ever happened to me. It is the thing that finally broke me out of my shell like you wanted. My theory is that you finally succeeded in signing me up for something that would work.</p>

                <p>Becoming an orientation leader is the reason I am here today. It inspired me to take the leap and apply to graduate programs. Ending up in this program has been an amazing experience, and I am so grateful that I ended up here. I like to think that you are a big reason why I have made it this far and I am so excited to take the lessons you taught me and become even more of a confident and supportive scholar-practitioner.</p>

                <p>With that thought in mind, I want to tell you all about everything I have learned as I have been moving through this program and exploring my scholar-practitioner identity. I feel like I have grown so much without being able to tell you all about it, so this feels like a great opportunity to do so.</p>

                <p>You know me, I like order and structure as much as you hated it, so I am going to go full “nerd” and use parts of our program to explain my growth to you. On the following two pages, you will find in-depth explanations of exactly what I have learned and how it ties back to this graduate program I have ended up in. I decided to focus on the two most important parts of my newfound professional identity: inclusive practice and transformative supervision.</p>

                <p>I hope you are as excited to hear about this as I am to tell you about it!</p>

                <p>To the Moon and Back,</p>
