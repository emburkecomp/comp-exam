            <h2 class="dearmom">Mom...</h2>

            <p>From day one of my life, you have always taught me that empathy and respect are two of the most important skills that someone can master. You were an educator and an advocate for kids with learning disabilities and those who struggled to learn how to talk. Finding ways to support each individual kid was something you did every day – always going above and beyond to find innovative ways to provide that support.</p>

            <p>Moving into my undergraduate career and working with user experience design, I used your approach to making the world a more equitable place as a foundation for what I wanted to do. When I changed my mind and applied to graduate programs, I wanted to push myself to bring these ideas into every facet of the work that I do every day. Between everything that you taught me, the things I learned about Universal Design in web development, and the content of the courses I have consumed during this program, I have made inclusive practice into the foundational core of my professional identity.</p>

            <p>Within this program, one of our competencies is to “Demonstrate an understanding of multicultural issues and competencies in higher education and act in ways that promote inclusive practice.” This is a competency that I find resonates deeply with me and something I think you would have been excited about.</p>

            <p>When I was growing up, I vividly remember how we struggled to keep ourselves afloat financially. I watched you struggle with chronic illnesses and started to show symptoms of having some of the same issues. You left before I fully came out and was true to myself, but you never hesitated to share your support with everyone you met.</p>

            <p>As someone who holds these identities and experiences, it feels fundamental that my practice is inclusive to every student that walks into these spaces. When I was a student, I always wanted to feel like my experiences were valued and supported. As a practitioner, I aim to be reflective within my own identities, specifically to understand where I hold power and where I should step back and make space for others.</p>

            <p>Within my field, we talk a lot about centering the student experience and providing support where needed. From my perspective – and yours as well I’m sure – the development and support of disabilities is a key component that most able-bodied practitioners take for granted. They don’t always consider the little things like the location of the accessible entrance (is it at the front of the building or by the dumpsters?) or using a microphone even if they think they can project their voice loud enough.</p>

            <p>I feel as though there is a misconception that most students don’t need accommodations and can be successful without those extra elements of support. However, when we look at the data for how students are or are not interacting with support systems in place at our institutions, we start to get a muddy picture.</p>

            <button class="accordion">The Muddy Picture...</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <ul>
                    <li>Roughly 1/3 of students (37%) who <i>have a disability</i> share it with their accessibility office – that means 2/3 of students <i>with a disability</i> are not telling their institution they need support (Delarosa & Elias, 2022).</li>

                    <li>Out of all students currently attending college in the United States, 11.1% of them report having a disability (Raue et al., 2011).</li>

                    <li>Over half (55%) of students who had an individualized education plan (IEP) in K-12 didn’t inform the institution and/or seek accommodations (Raue et al., 2011).</li>
                </ul>
            </div> <!-- close first accordion -->

            <p>This suggests to me that students are still feeling a stigma around asking for help and getting the support we provide to them. The solution from my lens is clear: we remove the barriers that exist and create a default of being inclusive and accessible. We need to stop the compulsory able-bodiedness that dominates accessible narratives and instead try to dismantle it.</p>

            <p>One of my favorite readings from our College Student Development class last spring was the section we covered on Crip Theory. Why? It gave me the language to describe the things I already wanted to do, and it gave me a common goal to refer to; to “destabilize without dematerializing identity” (Abes et al., p.69, 2019).</p>

            <p>The authors describe using this theory as, “to ‘crip’ is to expose discourses of compulsory able-bodiedness and able-mindedness, not only in contexts where disability is purposefully explored but also in contexts not explicitly focused on disability” (Abes et al., p. 66, 2019).</p>

            <button class="accordion">Crip Theory Definitions</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Some of my favorite terms* include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cripistemology</strong> refers to how knowledge is produced from the perspective of disabled individuals**</li>

                    <li><strong>Crip Time</strong> is a way of challenging the way we have normalized a fast-paced and, quite frankly, disabling lifestyle. To use <i>crip time</i> means that instead of changing the person to meet the normalized ‘clock,’ we instead shift and bend the clock to meet the needs of disabled bodies and minds.</li>

                    <li><strong>Forced Intimacy</strong> is the requirement for disabled individuals to share personal parts of themselves with others, whether they want to or not, in order to receive accommodations necessary for their success.</li>

                    <li><strong>Access Intimacy</strong> names the sense that another individual understands the needs of disabled individuals and is a safe person to share their individualized needs with.</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><i>*All terms and definitions cited from:</i> (Abes et al., 2019)</p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><i>**I use identity first language here, which is not only my preferred language as a disabled person, but it is also what many Crip Theory scholars use to highlight the ableist norms society asks us to conform to.</i></p>
            </div>

            <p>My two favorite words in the English language are universal design. Universal Design (UD) is design that is intended to level the playing field while also creating spaces that do not need additional supports. John Salmen puts it beautifully when he says, “… accessibility is about compliance, and universal design is about design that empowers people” (Salmen, p. 16, 2011). That is the kind of program design I want to promote, so I use the seven principles in my work every day.</p>

            <button class="accordion">The 7 Principles of Universal Design</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <ol>
                    <li>Equitable Use</li>
                    <li>Flexibility in use</li>
                    <li>Simple and intuitive use</li>
                    <li>Perceptible information</li>
                    <li>Tolerance for error</li>
                    <li>Low physical effort</li>
                    <li>Size and space for approach and use</li>
                </ol>
            </div> <!-- close third accordion -->

            <p>Inclusive practice is not this large-scale, difficult thing that we have to go out of our way to use. It can be in those little changes that make an enormous difference. These easy changes were the driving force behind my artifact for this competency.</p>

            <button class="accordion">It's Easy to Make Changes!</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>To some, I think this seems like a large, complicated ask. But it’s not. To fight back against these narratives can be simple:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a microphone and captions whenever you speak in front of groups.</li>

                    <li>Book spaces where the accessible entrance is the main entrance.</li>

                    <li>Don't choose activities and/or ice breakers that require a lot of physical movement.</li>

                    <li>Be aware of resources - like booking an interpreter or identifying shuttle routes to new locations.</li>

                    <li>Default to always having an interpreter (if budgets allow of course).</li>
                </ul>
            </div><!-- close accordion two -->
            
            <p>With Crip Theory, Universal Design, and my experiences with practice in mind, I decided to try something new and terrifying: I submitted a proposal to the national NODA Conference. The selection committee must have seen something they liked, because they accepted it, and I found myself in Minneapolis in October presenting this information.</p>

            <p>My presentation focused more heavily on visual UD and inclusion from a digital lens because I have a stronger background within that area that I could pull from. My NODAC presentation was designed to show practitioners how easy it can be to make the little changes, so their programs are more inclusive. I focused on practical things they have the power to change, and (hopefully) challenged them to think through and confront some of the dominant narratives we encounter when we plan events.</p>
        
            <p>To create my presentation, I used a four-part structure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I prepared data and statistics to explain why we care about inclusive practice.</li>
                <li>I reviewed foundational visual design principles to break down the complexity that is interactive design.</li>
                <li>I explained the seven principles of UD so they were familiar with this bigger theory.</li>
                <li>I introduced free tools they can use to test their current structures and find areas of improvement.</li>
            </ul> 

            <p>I drew on the theory I had in my back pocket, as well as the experiences I already had incorporating these ideas into inclusive practice. When I presented the information, I shared examples of my own practice: how I train my <i>all</i> the students I work with on Universal Design, I shared the easy steps to include captions during presentations without using WebEx or something similar, and I shared how I have seen my students become more comfortable sharing with me based on the approaches I take that default to meeting their needs rather than requiring them to disclose information to me in order to get that support.</p>

            <p>Without the confidence and understanding of higher education systems that I have gained throughout this program; I would not have been able to present this information at a national conference. While some of the content was pulled from my undergraduate degree, the understanding of higher education structures and contexts was what allowed me to tailor the information into a format that would be perceptible and flexible for higher education professionals to bring back to their home institutions.</p>

            <p>Presenting solo at a national conference was an achievement that I desperately wish you could have seen, Mom. You always pushed me to find my voice. Well, through my undergraduate degree, my experiences in this program, and my desire to be someone who promotes inclusion in all spaces, I was able to use my voice for good in front of over 100 people. That is an accomplishment that I will forever be excited I was able to have.</p>
